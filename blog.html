                <h4>Question- 1: what is the difference between var let and const in javascript?</h4>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong>: <strong> Var:</strong> The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.<br>
                <strong>Let:</strong> The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be accessible outside the particular block ({block}).<br>
                <strong>Const:</strong> The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it. When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.</p>

                <h4>Question- 2: What is the difference between the arrow function and the normal function?</h4>
                <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Arrow functions – a new feature introduced in ES6 – enable writing concise functions in JavaScript. While both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences between them. Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword. However, the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.</p>

                <h4><strong>Question-3: </strong>What is the difference between map(), foreach(), filter() and find()?</h4>
                <p><strong>Ans: </strong>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br>
                .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. <br>
                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <br>
                .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>
            </div>

                <h4><strong>Question-4:</strong> Why do we use template string in javascript?</h4>
                <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities. We insert a variable or expression by adding a dollar sign $ and curly braces {} into the string `${variable}`. This is much better than the alternative in old JavaScript where we had to concatenate a string.</p>
